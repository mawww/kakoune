= Autorestore

When Kakoune crashes, it automatically writes out unsaved changes to backup
files with predictable names. When you edit a file, if such a backup file
exists, this plugin will automatically load the content of the backup file
instead.

By default, backup files are deleted when restored. You can set the
`autorestore_purge_restored` option to `false` to prevent this.

If you don't want backups to be restored automatically, use the
`autorestore-disable` command to disable the feature for the current session,
or put it in your `kakrc` to disable the feature forever.
