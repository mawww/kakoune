            Please make sure to [search issues](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues?q=is%3Aissue) before creating a new one, to avoid duplicates and centralise conversations.

            If you need to have a question about the editor itself (options, behaviour, code…) answered, make sure to check the [documentation](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/tree/master/doc/pages) (also available via the `doc` command in the editor) or drop by [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#kakoune) to get instant feedback.

          placeholder: |
              If any specific configuration or environment settings are required to reproduce the issue, also describe them here.

      attributes:
          label: "Outcome"
          description: "What is the outcome of the reproducing steps above?"
          placeholder: |
              If the editor printed any error messages, or if you managed to obtain a backtrace, also document them here. Make sure to demangle the stacktrace by passing it to the `c++filt` command.

              Note that triggering the issue in the editor compiled in debug mode will produce more helpful messages, please consider re-building with `make debug=yes` to help us out.

          description: "What was the expected outcome of the reproducing steps above?"
          placeholder: |
              If the reproducing steps are self-evident, the expectations are simply “the editor should not crash”. In that case, you may ignore this field.
