            If you need to have a question about the editor itself (options, behaviour, codeâ€¦) answered, make sure to check the [documentation](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/tree/master/doc/pages) (also available via the `doc` command in the editor) or drop by [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#kakoune) to get instant feedback.
