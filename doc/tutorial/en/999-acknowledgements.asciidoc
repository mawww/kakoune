Have fun with Kakoune !
=======================

This concludes the tutorial.  It was intended to give a brief overview of
Kakoune, enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.

You are now encouraged to write your own scripts and mappings, to make kak
the editor YOU need.

This tutorial was written by @lisael and is inspired by Vim's builtin
vimtutor by Michael C. Pierce and Robert K. Ware, modified by Bram Moolenaar.
for Vim. Some lessons are verbatim copies of vimtutor lesson, so I guess they
are subject of Vim's terms of use, as I couldn't find the original tutorial's
license.

Finally, remember that editing code or text could be a boring task. Kak make
it fun again, either by providing powerful movements and edit commands and by
allowing easy integration with your Unix tools!
