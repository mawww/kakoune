This is not the help you're looking for
=======================================

Kakoune doesn't implement an extensive/extensible help system as, say, vim
does. This is not (only) lazyness, it's on purpose.

Kakoune emphasis on these central principles:

    1. Keep the core as simple as possible
    2. Give direct feedback to the user (with the help box)
    3. Incite the user to create and adapt their own tools
    
Thus, the main documentation should remain a single web page : https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/README.asciidoc

The usage of the commands is explained on completion command in the help box.
If it's unexistant or unclear, it's a bug. Please report it.

Kakoune also implements a tutorial to aprehend the main principles and basic
editing wokflow. Type `<esc>:tutorial<ret>` to start.

The [wiki](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki) is also a good place to learn
tips and tricks, find scripts and adapt them to your very own needs and
workflow.
