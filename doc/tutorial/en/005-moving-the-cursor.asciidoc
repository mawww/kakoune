=================

To move the cursor, press the h,j,k,l keys as indicated.
 
         ^
         k              Hint:  The h key is at the left and moves left.
   < h       l >               The l key is at the right and moves right.
         j                     The j key looks like a down arrow.

  1. Move the cursor around the screen until you are comfortable.

  2. type `<esc>,l` to see the next lesson

NOTE: If you are ever unsure about something you typed, press <esc> to place
      you in Normal mode.  Then retype the command you wanted.

NOTE: The cursor keys should also work.  But using hjkl you will be able to
      move around much faster, once you get used to it.  Really!
