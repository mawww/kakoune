NAME
----
registers - a

Description
-----------
Registers are named lists of text -instead of simply text- in order to interact
well with multiselection. They are used for various purposes, like storing
the last yanked text, or the captured groups associated with the selections.

Interacting
-----------
*<c-r><c>*::
	when in insert mode or in a prompt, insert the value stored in the
	*c* register (single character)

*"<c>*::
	in normal mode, select the *<c>* register (single character)

Alternate names
---------------

Non alphanumeric registers have an alternative name that can be used
in contexts where only alphanumeric identifiers are possible.

Default registers
-----------------
Most commands using a register default to a specific one if not specified:

*"* (dquote)::
	default yank register, used by yanking and pasting commands like *y*, *p*
	and *R*

*/* (slash)::
	default search register, used by regex based commands like *s*, ***
	or */*

*@* (arobase)::
	default macro register, used by *q* and *Q*

*^* (caret)::
	default mark register, used by *z* and *Z*

*|* (pipe)::
	default shell command register, used by command that spawn a subshell such as
	*|*, *<a-|>*, *!* or *<a-!>*

Special registers
-----------------
Some registers are not general purposes, they cannot be written to, but they
contain some special data

*%* (percent)::
	current buffer name

*.* (dot)::
	current selection contents

*#* (hash)::
	selection indices (first selection has 1, second has 2, ...)

*_* (underscore)::
	null register, always empty

Integer registers
-----------------
Registers *1* to *9* hold the grouped sub-matches of the regular
expression used to make the last selection. Example: applying the
following regular expression to the date of the day would put the day of
the week in register *1*, the month in register *2*, and the day of the
month in register *3*, but select the entire date:
