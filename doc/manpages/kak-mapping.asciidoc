mapping - a

Description
-----------
Creating and removing shortcuts boils down to the following commands,
respectively:

---------------------------------------
map [flags] <scope> <mode> <key> <keys>
unmap <scope> <mode> <key> [<expected>]
---------------------------------------

The *map* command makes *key* behave as if the *keys* sequence was typed.

*mode* dictates in what context the mapping will be available:

	*insert*::
		insert mode
	*normal*::
		normal mode
	*prompt*::
		prompts, such as when entering a command through *:*, or a regex through */*
	*menu*::
		mode entered when a menu is displayed with the 'menu' command
	*user*::
		mode entered when the user prefix is hit (default: ',')
	*goto*::
		mode entered when the goto key is hit (default: 'g')
	*view*::
		mode entered when the view key is hit (default: 'v')
	*object*::
		mode entered when an object selection is triggered (e.g. '<a-i>')

The context of execution of the above modes is always the current one at the
time of execution of the mapping, except for *user* mode (always executed
in a 'normal' context).

An optional *-docstring* switch followed by a string can be used
to describe what the mapping does. This docstring will be used
in autoinfo boxes.

The *unmap* command removes a mapping of *key* in the given *scope* and
*mode*. If *expected* is specified, the mapping is removed only if it is
set to the same sequence of keys passed using the *expected* argument.

For more information about the values of the *scope* parameter, refer to
the 'scopes' documentation page.
