NAME
----
execeval - a

Description
-----------
The *exec* and *eval* commands can be used to run Kakoune commands, and
should be used as follows:

----------------------------
exec [<flags>] <key> ...
eval [<flags>] <command> ...
----------------------------

*exec* runs keys as if they were pressed, whereas *eval* executes its given
parameters as if they were entered in the command prompt. By default, their
execution happens within the context of the current client, and stops when
the last key/command is reached, or an error is raised.

These two commands also save the following registers, who are then restored
when the commands have been executed: */*, *"*, *|*, *^*, *@*.

Optional flags
--------------
*-client* <name>::
	execute in the context of the client named *name*

*-try-client* <name>::
	execute in the context of the client named *name* if such client
	exists, or else in the current context

*-draft*::
	execute in a copy of the context of the selected client. Modifications
	to the selections or input state will not affect the client. This
	permits to make some modification to the buffer without modifying
	the userâ€™s selection

*-itersel* (requires -draft)::
	execute once per selection, in a context with only the considered
	selection. This permits avoiding cases where the selections may
	get merged

*-buffer* <names>::
	execute in the context of each buffers in the comma separated list
	*names*, as a name can be used to iterate on all buffers

*-no-hooks*::
	disable hook execution while executing the keys/commands

*-with-maps*::
	use user key mapping in instead of built in keys (*exec* only)

*-save-regs* <regs>::
	regs is a string of registers to be restored after execution (overwrites
	the list of registers saved by default, c.f. description)
