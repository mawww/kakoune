= Changelog

This changelog contains major and/or breaking changes to Kakoune between
released versions.

== Development version

* `%sh{...}` strings are not reparsed automatically anymore, they need
  to go through an explicit `evaluate-commands`

* The `-allow-override` switch from `define-command` has been renamed
  `-override`.

* The search prompt uses buffer word completion so that fuzzy completion
  can be used to quickly search for a buffer word.

* The `wrap` highlighter can accept a new `-marker <marker_text>` switch.

== Kakoune 2018.04.13

First official Kakoune release.
