= Mapping

== Description

Creating and removing shortcuts boils down to the following commands,
respectively:

---------------------------------------
map [flags] <scope> <mode> <key> <keys>
unmap <scope> <mode> <key> [<expected>]
---------------------------------------

The *map* command makes *key* behave as if the *keys* sequence was typed.

*mode* dictates in what context the mapping will be available:

    *insert*::
        insert mode
    *normal*::
        normal mode
    *prompt*::
        prompts, such as when entering a command through *:*, or a regex through */*
    *menu*::
        mode entered when a menu is displayed with the 'menu' command
    *user*::
        mode entered when the user prefix is hit (default: ',')
    *goto*::
        mode entered when the goto key is hit (default: 'g')
    *view*::
        mode entered when the view key is hit (default: 'v')
    *object*::
        mode entered when an object selection is triggered (e.g. '<a-i>')

The context of execution of the above modes is always the current one at the
time of execution of the mapping, except for *user* mode (always executed
in a 'normal' context). Refer to <<modes#,`:doc modes`>> for more details.

An optional *-docstring* switch followed by a string can be used
to describe what the mapping does. This docstring will be used
in autoinfo boxes.

The *unmap* command removes a mapping of *key* in the given *scope* and
*mode*. If *expected* is specified, the mapping is removed only if it is
set to the same sequence of keys passed using the *expected* argument.

For more information about the values of the *scope* parameter, refer to
<<scopes#,`:doc scopes`>>.

== Mappable keys

See <<keys#,`:doc keys`>> to discover the list of default bindings.

For *key* and *keys* in the *map* command, the following key names can
be used:

*x*, *<x>*::
    Most keys, especially alphabetic keys, represent themselves.
    Keys can also be wrapped in angle-brackets for consistency
    with the non-alphabetic keys below.

*X*, *<X>*::
    Holding down Shift while pressing the *x* key.

*<c-x>*::
    Holding down Control while pressing the *x* key.

*<a-x>*::
    Holding down Alt while pressing the *x* key.

*<c-a-x>*::
    Holding down Control and Alt while pressing the *x* key.

*<lt>*, *<gt>*::
    The *<* and *>* characters.

*<plus>*, *<minus>*::
    The *+* and *-* characters..

*<ret>*::
    The Return or Enter key.

*<space>*::
    The space bar.

*<tab>*::
    The Tab key.

*<backtab>*::
    The reverse-tab key. This is Shift-Tab on most keyboards.

*<backspace>*::
    The Backspace (delete to the left) key.

*<del>*::
    The Delete (to the right) key.

*<DEL>*::
    Holding down Shift while pressing the Delete (to the right) key.

*<esc>*::
    The Escape key.

*<up>*, *<down>*, *<left>*, *<right>*::
*<pageup>*, *<pagedown>*, *<home>*, *<end>*::
    The usual cursor-movement keys.

*<UP>*, *<DOWN>*, *<LEFT>*, *<RIGHT>*::
*<PAGEUP>*, *<PAGEDOWN>*, *<HOME>*, *<END>*::
    Holding down Shift while pressing the usual cursor-movement keys.

*<f1>*, *<f2>*, ...*<f12>*::
    Function keys.
