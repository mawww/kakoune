= Execute-keys and Evaluate-commands

*execute-keys* [<switches>] <key> ...::
    Run keys as if they were pressed.

*evaluate-commands* [<switches>] <command> ...::
    Evaluate specified commands as if they were entered into the command
    prompt.

By default, the execution of both commands happens within the context of
the current client, and stops when the last key/command is reached or an
error occurs.

Without the *-save-regs* switch, *execute-keys* saves the following registers, which
are then restored when the keys have been executed: */*, *"*, *|*, *^*,
*@*, *:*. *evaluate-commands* doesn't save any registers by default.
(See <<registers#,`:doc registers`>>)

== Switches for both commands

*-client* <name>::
    Execute in the context of the client *name*.

*-try-client* <name>::
    Execute in the context of the client *name* if such client exists,
    or else in the current context.

*-draft*::
    Execute in a copy of the context of the selected client. Modifications to
    the selections or input state will not affect the client. This permits
    making modifications to the buffer without modifying the userâ€™s
    selection.

*-itersel*::
    Execute once per selection, each having its own context. This prevents
    situations where selections get merged.

*-buffer* <names>::
    Execute in the context of each buffer specified in the comma separated
    list *names*. `*` can be used as a *name* to iterate over all non-debug
    buffers.
    (See <<buffers#debug-buffers, `:doc buffers`>>)

*-save-regs* <regs>::
    *regs* is a string of registers to be restored after execution (overwrites
    the list of registers saved by default).

== Switches specific to *evaluate-commands*

*-no-hooks*::
    Disable hook execution while executing the keys/commands.
    (See <<hooks#disabling-hooks,`:doc hooks`>>)

*-verbatim*::
    Don't reparse and split positional arguments. Forward them exactly
    as specified.

== Switches specific to *execute-keys*

*-with-maps*::
    Use a custom key mapping instead of the built-in one.
    (See <<mapping#,`:doc mapping`>>)

*-with-hooks*::
    Execute keys and trigger existing hooks.
    (See <<hooks#,`:doc hooks`>>)
